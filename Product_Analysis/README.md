## Product Sales Analysis


# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data, particularly within the electronics sector. Our goal is to uncover insights that can drive better product decisions, improve sales strategies, and identify potential areas for growth. By leveraging data from both internal and external sources, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics and customer behavior.


## Data Sources

We utilize multiple datasets for our analysis:

`electronics.csv`: Raw sales data for electronic products.
`electronics_cleaned.csv`: Processed and cleaned data ready for analysis.
External Dataset: Publicly available data from Kaggle: Amazon Electronics Sales Data. Note: You may need to create a free Kaggle account to access this dataset.


## Notebooks

Product_Sales_Analysis.ipynb: Main notebook for analyzing product sales, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.
Sales_Analysis.ipynb: Supplementary analysis focusing on broader sales trends and patterns.


## Technologies

We employ the following Python libraries for data analysis and visualization:

Pandas (Data manipulation)
NumPy (Numerical computing)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)


## Task List

1. Import libraries and load data: Setting up the environment and loading datasets.
2. Clean and preprocess data: Ensuring data quality and consistency for accurate analysis.
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA): Uncovering patterns, trends, and insights through visualization and statistical analysis.
4. Draw conclusions and insights: Summarizing findings and identifying actionable insights.


## Requirements

To run the notebooks and replicate the analysis, ensure you have all necessary Python packages installed. You can find the list of requirements in `requirements.txt`.


## Running the Analysis

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
2. Install the required Python packages using:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter and run the cells to perform the analysis.

By combining internal sales data with external sources, this project aims to provide a robust analysis of the electronics market, offering valuable insights to drive business decisions.
